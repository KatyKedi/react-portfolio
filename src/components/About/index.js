                        I'm an aspiring Computational Linguist, and I am hoping to find some great programmers to learn from and collaborate with as I work on gaining real world coding experience. Over the past few years, I attended UC Santa Barbara where I earned a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Linguistics and UC Davis Continuing Education where I earned a Certificate in Full Stack Web Development. In my coursework, I worked on a plethora of individual projects as well as team projects. In these projects I engineered, designed, developed, tested and implemented new applications, modifications to existing applications and met functional requirements established for the user.

                        From my studies at UC Santa Barbara and UC Davis, I have developed skills in Javascript, Visual Studio.Net, RESTful Web Services, and SQL, MySQL, Sequelize, MongoDB, Mongoose, GraphQL, Python, and Node.js. Packages I have expertise in for Node.js include the Express server and the testing framework Jest.

                        In my spare time, I am studying Turkish and Spanish to build on what I have learned of those languages in the past. I also had years of ASL experience in the past that I want to revisit to become fluent again. Please feel free to contact me if you are also learning these languages and would like a partner to practice with!
